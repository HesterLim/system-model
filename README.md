## Overview

### The Zombie apocalypse

The zombie apocalypse has started in the real world, and we are concerned about the short-term survival of the human race. We need you to build a model to prevent it from ending the human race in the real world. Although the details of a zombie infection vary from outbreak to outbreak, the common characteristics are:
- An outbreak begins when a small number of zombies appear in an otherwise susceptible population. The reports we have suggest there are currently 42 zombies in Canberra, which has a population of 400,000 humans.
- A human becomes a zombie on average 3 days after being bitten by a zombie.
- The only way that a zombie can be killed is by a human destroying its brain.
- When a zombie encounters a human, they fight, ending in either the human being bitten or the zombieâ€™s brain being destroyed.
- From the initial reports, it seems a zombie is biting on average 4 humans before being destroyed.
- On average, a specific zombie will encounter a specific uninfected human once every 100 days.
